libinfinity 0.6.7 has been released. This is a bugfix release in the 0.6.x series. Primarily, it fixes a problem where the library would cause a crash when linked against glib 2.46 or newer. It also fixes potential crashes in some other uncommon situations. It is recommended to update to this new version of libinfinity, especially if you plan to upgrade glib to 2.46 anytime soon.
