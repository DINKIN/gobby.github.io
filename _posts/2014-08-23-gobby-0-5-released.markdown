Gobby 0.5.0 has been released today, together with libinfinity 0.6.1. These
packages represent new major versions of Gobby, and puts the experimental
0.4.9x series on a more stable footing. Significant new features include a
built-in server in Gobby so that it is no longer necessary to run a dedicated
server to connect to another computer running Gobby, and a permission system
to grant and revoke permissions from different users. Gobby 0.5.0 is fully
compatible to Gobby 0.4.94.

Gobby 0.5.0 can be [downloaded](https://github.com/gobby/gobby/wiki/Download)
from the Wiki page on GitHub.
