libinfinity 0.6.5 has been released. This is a bugfix release in the 0.6.x series. It fixes an error message in the server log stating the reason a client certificate was rejected, and several potential crashes where data would be sent to already closed connections. Libinfinity 0.6.5 also builds cleanly on FreeBSD now.

libinfinity 0.6.5 can be [downloaded](https://github.com/gobby/gobby/wiki/Download)
from the Wiki page on GitHub.
