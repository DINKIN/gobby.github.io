libinfinity 0.6.3 has been released, a bugfix release in the 0.6.x
series. It fixes the certificate dialog being shown even when the
certificate has already been accepted previously, a possible timing
attack against the server password and it allows to configure the
`directory-sync` plugin such that non-owners can read the created
directories as well.

libinfinity 0.6.3 can be [downloaded](https://github.com/gobby/gobby/wiki/Download)
from the Wiki page on GitHub.
